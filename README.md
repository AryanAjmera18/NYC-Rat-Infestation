## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Executive Summary

**Project Name:** NYC Rodent Inspection Data Analytics and Dashboard  

### Brief Summary
This project involves designing and deploying an interactive dashboard to analyze rodent inspection data across New York City. The dashboard provides actionable insights on rodent inspections from **2009 to 2025**.

### Objectives
- Process large-scale rodent inspection data
- Build a real-time interactive dashboard for visualization
- Provide borough-level trends and patterns

### Technologies Used
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Folium + Streamlit-Folium
- Matplotlib

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Execution Instructions

### Repository  
(https://github.com/AryanAjmera18/NYC-Rat-Infestation)

### High-Level Code Logic
```bash
1. Preprocess raw CSV data:
   python src/etl/process_rodent_data.py           --input data/raw/rodent_inspections.csv           --output data/processed/rodent_inspections.parquet

2. Subset data for Tableau export:
   python dashboards/export.py

3. Launch the Streamlit dashboard:
   streamlit run src/app/streamlit_app.py
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Technological Challenges

- **Windows Hadoop errors:** Resolved by disabling native Hadoop IO (`spark.hadoop.io.nativeio.enabled=false`)
- **Memory overload:** Limited dataset to 2009‚Äì2025; optimized Spark partitions
- **Slow map rendering:** Removed heavy clustering map for faster interactivity

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Changes in Technology

We initially planned to use only Tableau.  
**Streamlit was added** to enable:
- Real-time filtering
- Better interactivity
- Lighter deployment without Tableau Server

This greatly improved usability and insights.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Uncovered Aspects from Presentation

Due to time constraints, we couldn‚Äôt demo:
- `dashboards/export.py` pipeline for Tableau export
- Streamlit + Folium maps (which enhanced map interactivity)

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Combining Spark + Streamlit provided a scalable + interactive solution

### Challenges Faced
- Local memory limits on laptops
- Schema mismatches in raw data

### Solutions
- Filtering to 2009‚Äì2025 range
- Added schema validation and structured logging

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Future Improvements

If we had more time, we would:
- Add Spark Structured Streaming for live data
- Deploy fully inside Docker on cloud
- Add advanced clustering & predictive ML models

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Data Sources and Results

### üìä Data Source
[NYC Open Data Rodent Inspection Dataset (2009‚Äì2025)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj)

### üìà Results
- Heatmap of rodent inspections by borough
- Monthly bar chart of inspections
- Yearly trend line chart
- Pie chart of inspection results

### üìã Key Observations
- Brooklyn & Manhattan show highest rodent activity
- Peak rodent inspection activity in mid-2010s
